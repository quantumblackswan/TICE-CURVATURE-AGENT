# 🧠 TICE Curvature Intelligence Agent

> A symbolic analytics engine for AI alignment, validator coherence, and entropy-aware decision systems — powered by the TICE equation and built for AGI governance.

---

## 🌐 Overview

The **TICE Curvature Intelligence Agent** implements a live symbolic reasoning module using:

- **Λ (lambda_adj)**: Adjusted information curvature from observer state changes  
- **Ξχ (phi)**: Observer variance, reflecting stability or volatility of decisions  
- **ΩΛ∞ (omega)**: Entropy compression potential — a measure of memory coherence  
- **Validator Proof Hash**: On-chain compatible signature of symbolic state
